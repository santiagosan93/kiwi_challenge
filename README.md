Models
---

User -
I decided to create this model to implement key recognition and authentication when uploading a CSV file.


Device --
This is the main model. The instance variables assigned to Device are the following: @timestamp, @device_serial_unmber, @device_type, @status.

---
Class and Instance methods
---

Self.get_devices -
this metheod returns an array with the following format [[device_serial_number, number_of_times_for_a_specific_day]]. This array is sorted from most pormted in a day to least.

Self.get_types -
Very similiar to get_devices in the sense that queries the database and organices the result. In this case get types recieves a day a type and a status, and it returns the count of the ammount of devices with those setings that were promted on a selected day.

Find_percentage-
This method finds the amount of times that a device was prompted 7 days before the passed day and calls calculate_percentage.

Calculate_percentage-
takes two numbers and compares the growth in percentage between them
